A man’s a man.\\nSeparate beds of course you understand.”\\nThe night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.\\n“Who’s that man sleeping in the office chair?\\nHas he had the refusal of my chance?”\\n“He was afraid of being robbed or murdered.\\nWhat do you say?”\\n“I’ll have to have a bed.”\\nThe night clerk led him up three flights of stairs\\nAnd down a narrow passage full of doors,\\nAt the last one of which he knocked and entered.\\n“Lafe, here’s a fellow wants to share your room.”\\n“Show him this way. I’m not afraid of him.\\nI’m not so drunk I can’t take care of myself.”\\nThe night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.\\n“This will be yours. Good-night,” he said, and went.\\n“Lafe was the name, I think?”\\n“Yes, Layfayette.\\nYou got it the first time. And yours?”\\n“Magoon.\\nDoctor Magoon.”\\n“A Doctor?”\\n“Well, a teacher.”\\n“Professor Square-the-circle-till-you’re-tired?\\nHold on, there’s something I don’t think of now\\nThat I had on my mind to ask the first\\nMan that knew anything I happened in with.\\nI’ll ask you later—don’t let me forget it.”\\nThe Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.\\nA man? A brute. Naked above the waist,\\nHe sat there creased and shining in the light,\\nFumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.\\n“I’m moving into a size-larger shirt.\\nI’ve felt mean lately; mean’s no name for it.\\nI just found what the matter was to-night:\\nI’ve been a-choking like a nursery tree\\nWhen it outgrows the wire band of its name tag.\\nI blamed it on the hot spell we’ve been having.\\n’Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,\\nNot liking to own up I’d grown a size.\\nNumber eighteen this is. What size do you wear?”\\nThe Doctor caught his throat convulsively.\\n“Oh—ah—fourteen—fourteen.”\\n“Fourteen! You say so!\\nI can remember when I wore fourteen.\\nAnd come to think I must have back at home\\nMore than a hundred collars, size fourteen.\\nToo bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.\\nThey’re yours and welcome; let me send them to you.\\nWhat makes you stand there on one leg like that?\\nYou’re not much furtherer than where Kike left you.\\nYou act as if you wished you hadn’t come.\\nSit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous.”\\nThe Doctor made a subdued dash for it,\\nAnd propped himself at bay against a pillow.\\n“Not that way, with your shoes on Kike’s white bed.\\nYou can’t rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off.”\\n“Don’t touch me, please—I say, don’t touch me, please.\\nI’ll not be put to bed by you, my man.”\\n“Just as you say. Have it your own way then.\\n‘My man’ is it? You talk like a professor.\\nSpeaking of who’s afraid of who, however,\\nI’m thinking I have more to lose than you\\nIf anything should happen to be wrong.\\nWho wants to cut your number fourteen throat!\\nLet’s have a show down as an evidence\\nOf good faith. There is ninety dollars.\\nCome, if you’re not afraid.”\\n“I’m not afraid.\\nThere’s five: that’s all I carry.”\\n“I can search you?\\nWhere are you moving over to? Stay still.\\nYou’d better tuck your money under you\\nAnd sleep on it the way I always do\\nWhen I’m with people I don’t trust at night.”\\n“Will you believe me if I put it there\\nRight on the counterpane—that I do trust you?”\\n“You’d say so, Mister Man.—I’m a collector.\\nMy ninety isn’t mine—you won’t think that.\\nI pick it up a dollar at a time\\nAll round the country for the Weekly News,\\nPublished in Bow. You know the Weekly News?”\\n“Known it since I was young.”\\n“Then you know me.\\nNow we are getting on together—talking.\\nI’m sort of Something for it at the front.\\nMy business is to find what people want:\\nThey pay for it, and so they ought to have it.\\nFairbanks, he says to me—he’s editor—\\nFeel out the public sentiment—he says.\\nA good deal comes on me when all is said.\\nThe only trouble is we disagree\\nIn politics: I’m Vermont Democrat—\\nYou know what that is, sort of double-dyed;\\nThe News has always been Republican.\\nFairbanks, he says to me, ‘Help us this year,’\\nMeaning by us their ticket. ‘No,’ I says,\\n‘I can’t and won’t. You’ve been in long enough:\\nIt’s time you turned around and boosted us.\\nYou’ll have to pay me more than ten a week\\nIf I’m expected to elect Bill Taft.\\nI doubt if I could do it anyway.’“\\n“You seem to shape the paper’s policy.”\\n“You see I’m in with everybody, know ’em all.\\nI almost know their farms as well as they do.”\\n“You drive around? It must be pleasant work.”\\n“It’s business, but I can’t say it’s not fun.\\nWhat I like best’s the lay of different farms,\\nComing out on them from a stretch of woods,\\nOr over a hill or round a sudden corner.\\nI like to find folks getting out in spring,\\nRaking the dooryard, working near the house.\\nLater they get out further in the fields.\\nEverything’s shut sometimes except the barn;\\nThe family’s all away in some back meadow.\\nThere’s a hay load a-coming—when it comes.\\nAnd later still they all get driven in:\\nThe fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches\\nStripped to bare ground, the apple trees\\nTo whips and poles. There’s nobody about.\\nThe chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking.\\nAnd I lie back and ride. I take the reins\\nOnly when someone’s coming, and the mare\\nStops when she likes: I tell her when to go.\\nI’ve spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.\\nShe’s got so she turns in at every house\\nAs if she had some sort of curvature,\\nNo matter if I have no errand there.\\nShe thinks I’m sociable. I maybe am.\\nIt’s seldom I get down except for meals, though.\\nFolks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,\\nAll in a family row down to the youngest.”\\n“One would suppose they might not be as glad\\nTo see you as you are to see them.”\\n“Oh,\\nBecause I want their dollar. I don’t want\\nAnything they’ve not got. I never dun.\\nI’m there, and they can pay me if they like.\\nI go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.\\nSorry there is no cup to give you a drink.\\nI drink out of the bottle—not your style.\\nMayn’t I offer you——?”\\n“No, no, no, thank you.”\\n“Just as you say. Here’s looking at you then.—\\nAnd now I’m leaving you a little while.\\nYou’ll rest easier when I’m gone, perhaps—\\nLie down—let yourself go and get some sleep.\\nBut first—let’s see—what was I going to ask you?\\nThose collars—who shall I address them to,\\nSuppose you aren’t awake when I come back?”\\n“Really, friend, I can’t let you. You—may need them.”\\n“Not till I shrink, when they’ll be out of style.”\\n“But really I—I have so many collars.”\\n“I don’t know who I rather would have have them.\\nThey’re only turning yellow where they are.\\nBut you’re the doctor as the saying is.\\nI’ll put the light out.

You get some sleep.\\nI’ll knock so-fashion and peep round the door\\nWhen I come back so you’ll know who it is.\\nThere’s nothing I’m afraid of like scared people.\\nI don’t want you should shoot me in the head.\\nWhat am I doing carrying off this bottle?\\nThere now, you get some sleep.”\\nHe shut the door.\\nThe Doctor slid a little down the pillow.',\n",
              " 'We chanced in passing by that afternoon        \\nTo catch it in a sort of special picture        \\nAmong tar-banded ancient cherry trees,        \\nSet well back from the road in rank lodged grass,        \\nThe little cottage we were speaking of,                5\\nA front with just a door between two windows,        \\nFresh painted by the shower a velvet black.        \\nWe paused, the minister and I, to look.        \\nHe made as if to hold it at arm’s length        \\nOr put the leaves aside that framed it in.               \\n“Pretty,” he said. “Come in. No one will care.”        \\nThe path was a vague parting in the grass        \\nThat led us to a weathered window-sill.        \\nWe pressed our faces to the pane. “You see,” he said,        \\n“Everything’s as she left it when she died.                \\nHer sons won’t sell the house or the things in it.        \\nThey say they mean to come and summer here        \\nWhere they were boys. They haven’t come this year.        \\nThey live so far away—one is out west—        \\nIt will be hard for them to keep their word.                \\nAnyway they won’t have the place disturbed.”        \\nA buttoned hair-cloth lounge spread scrolling arms        \\nUnder a crayon portrait on the wall        \\nDone sadly from an old daguerreotype.        \\n“That was the father as he went to war.                \\nShe always, when she talked about war,        \\nSooner or later came and leaned, half knelt        \\nAgainst the lounge beside it, though I doubt        \\nIf such unlifelike lines kept power to stir        \\nAnything in her after all the years.                \\nHe fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg,        \\nI ought to know—it makes a difference which:        \\nFredericksburg wasn’t Gettysburg, of course.        \\nBut what I’m getting to is how forsaken        \\nA little cottage this has always seemed;                \\nSince she went more than ever, but before—        \\nI don’t mean altogether by the lives        \\nThat had gone out of it, the father first,        \\nThen the two sons, till she was left alone.        \\n(Nothing could draw her after those two sons.                \\nShe valued the considerate neglect        \\nShe had at some cost taught them after years.)        \\nI mean by the world’s having passed it by—        \\nAs we almost got by this afternoon.        \\nIt always seems to me a sort of mark                \\nTo measure how far fifty years have brought us.        \\nWhy not sit down if you are in no haste?        \\nThese doorsteps seldom have a visitor.        \\nThe warping boards pull out their own old nails        \\nWith none to tread and put them in their place.                \\nShe had her own idea of things, the old lady.        \\nAnd she liked talk. She had seen Garrison        \\nAnd Whittier, and had her story of them.        \\nOne wasn’t long in learning that she thought        \\nWhatever else the Civil War was for                \\nIt wasn’t just to keep the States together,        \\nNor just to free the slaves, though it did both.        \\nShe wouldn’t have believed those ends enough        \\nTo have given outright for them all she gave.        \\nHer giving somehow touched the principle                \\nThat all men are created free and equal.        \\nAnd to hear her quaint phrases—so removed        \\nFrom the world’s view to-day of all those things.        \\nThat’s a hard mystery of Jefferson’s.        \\nWhat did he mean? Of course the easy way                \\nIs to decide it simply isn’t true.        \\nIt may not be. I heard a fellow say so.        \\nBut never mind, the Welshman got it planted        \\nWhere it will trouble us a thousand years.        \\nEach age will have to reconsider it.                \\nYou couldn’t tell her what the West was saying,        \\nAnd what the South to her serene belief.        \\nShe had some art of hearing and yet not        \\nHearing the latter wisdom of the world.        \\nWhite was the only race she ever knew.                \\nBlack she had scarcely seen, and yellow never.        \\nBut how could they be made so very unlike        \\nBy the same hand working in the same stuff?        \\nShe had supposed the war decided that.        \\nWhat are you going to do with such a person?                \\nStrange how such innocence gets its own way.        \\nI shouldn’t be surprised if in this world        \\nIt were the force that would at last prevail.        \\nDo you know but for her there was a time        \\nWhen to please younger members of the church,                \\nOr rather say non-members in the church,        \\nWhom we all have to think of nowadays,        \\nI would have changed the Creed a very little?        \\nNot that she ever had to ask me not to;        \\nIt never got so far as that; but the bare thought                \\nOf her old tremulous bonnet in the pew,        \\nAnd of her half asleep was too much for me.        \\nWhy, I might wake her up and startle her.        \\nIt was the words ‘descended into Hades’        \\nThat seemed too pagan to our liberal youth.                \\nYou know they suffered from a general onslaught.        \\nAnd well, if they weren’t true why keep right on        \\nSaying them like the heathen? We could drop them.        \\nOnly—there was the bonnet in the pew.        \\nSuch a phrase couldn’t have meant much to her.                \\nBut suppose she had missed it from the Creed        \\nAs a child misses the unsaid Good-night,        \\nAnd falls asleep with heartache—how should I feel?        \\nI’m just as glad she made me keep hands off,        \\nFor, dear me, why abandon a belief                \\nMerely because it ceases to be true.        \\nCling to it long enough, and not a doubt        \\nIt will turn true again, for so it goes.        \\nMost of the change we think we see in life        \\nIs due to truths being in and out of favour.               \\nAs I sit here, and oftentimes, I wish        \\nI could be monarch of a desert land        \\nI could devote and dedicate forever        \\nTo the truths we keep coming back and back to.        \\nSo desert it would have to be, so walled                \\nBy mountain ranges half in summer snow,        \\nNo one would covet it or think it worth        \\nThe pains of conquering to force change on.        \\nScattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly        \\nSand dunes held loosely in tamarisk                \\nBlown over and over themselves in idleness.        \\nSand grains should sugar in the natal dew        \\nThe babe born to the desert, the sand storm        \\nRetard mid-waste my cowering caravans—        \\n“There are bees in this wall.” He struck the clapboards,                \\nFierce heads looked out; small bodies pivoted.        \\nWe rose to go. Sunset blazed on the windows.',\n",
              " '\"You ought to have seen what I saw on my way \\nTo the village, through Mortenson\\'s pasture to-day: \\nBlueberries as big as the end of your thumb, \\nReal sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum \\nIn the cavernous pail of the first one to come!         \\nAnd all ripe together, not some of them green \\nAnd some of them ripe! You ought to have seen!\" \\n\"I don\\'t know what part of the pasture you mean.\" \\n\"You know where they cut off the woods—let me see— \\nIt was two years ago—or no!—can it be         \\nNo longer than that?—and the following fall \\nThe fire ran and burned it all up but the wall.\" \\n\"Why, there hasn\\'t been time for the bushes to grow. \\nThat\\'s always the way with the blueberries, though: \\nThere may not have been the ghost of a sign         \\nOf them anywhere under the shade of the pine, \\nBut get the pine out of the way, you may burn \\nThe pasture all over until not a fern \\nOr grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick, \\nAnd presto, they\\'re up all around you as thick         \\nAnd hard to explain as a conjuror\\'s trick.\" \\n\"It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit. \\nI taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot. \\nAnd after all really they\\'re ebony skinned: \\nThe blue\\'s but a mist from the breath of the wind,         \\nA tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand, \\nAnd less than the tan with which pickers are tanned.\" \\n\"Does Mortenson know what he has, do you think?\" \\n\"He may and not care and so leave the chewink \\nTo gather them for him—you know what he is.         \\nHe won\\'t make the fact that they\\'re rightfully his \\nAn excuse for keeping us other folk out.\" \\n\"I wonder you didn\\'t see Loren about.\" \\n\"The best of it was that I did. Do you know, \\nI was just getting through what the field had to show         \\nAnd over the wall and into the road, \\nWhen who should come by, with a democrat-load \\nOf all the young chattering Lorens alive, \\nBut Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive.\" \\n\"He saw you, then? What did he do? Did he frown?\"         \\n\"He just kept nodding his head up and down. \\nYou know how politely he always goes by. \\nBut he thought a big thought—I could tell by his eye— \\nWhich being expressed, might be this in effect: \\n\\'I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect,         \\nTo ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.\\'\" \\n\"He\\'s a thriftier person than some I could name.\" \\n\"He seems to be thrifty; and hasn\\'t he need, \\nWith the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed? \\nHe has brought them all up on wild berries, they say,         \\nLike birds. They store a great many away. \\nThey eat them the year round, and those they don\\'t eat \\nThey sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet.\" \\n\"Who cares what they say? It\\'s a nice way to live, \\nJust taking what Nature is willing to give,         \\nNot forcing her hand with harrow and plow.\" \\n\"I wish you had seen his perpetual bow— \\nAnd the air of the youngsters! Not one of them turned, \\nAnd they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned.\" \\n\"I wish I knew half what the flock of them know         \\nOf where all the berries and other things grow, \\nCranberries in bogs and raspberries on top \\nOf the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop. \\nI met them one day and each had a flower \\nStuck into his berries as fresh as a shower;         \\nSome strange kind—they told me it hadn\\'t a name.\" \\n\"I\\'ve told you how once not long after we came, \\nI almost provoked poor Loren to mirth \\nBy going to him of all people on earth \\nTo ask if he knew any fruit to be had         \\nFor the picking. The rascal, he said he\\'d be glad \\nTo tell if he knew. But the year had been bad. \\nThere had been some berries—but those were all gone. \\nHe didn\\'t say where they had been. He went on: \\n\\'I\\'m sure—I\\'m sure\\'—as polite as could be.         \\nHe spoke to his wife in the door, \\'Let me see, \\nMame, we don\\'t know any good berrying place?\\' \\nIt was all he could do to keep a straight face. \\n\"If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him, \\nHe\\'ll find he\\'s mistaken. See here, for a whim,         \\nWe\\'ll pick in the Mortensons\\' pasture this year. \\nWe\\'ll go in the morning, that is, if it\\'s clear, \\nAnd the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet. \\nIt\\'s so long since I picked I almost forget \\nHow we used to pick berries: we took one look round,         \\nThen sank out of sight like trolls underground, \\nAnd saw nothing more of each other, or heard, \\nUnless when you said I was keeping a bird \\nAway from its nest, and I said it was you. \\n\\'Well, one of us is.\\' For complaining it flew         \\nAround and around us. And then for a while \\nWe picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile, \\nAnd I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout \\nToo loud for the distance you were, it turned out, \\nFor when you made answer, your voice was as low         \\nAs talking—you stood up beside me, you know.\" \\n\"We sha\\'n\\'t have the place to ourselves to enjoy— \\nNot likely, when all the young Lorens deploy. \\nThey\\'ll be there to-morrow, or even to-night. \\nThey won\\'t be too friendly—they may be polite—         \\nTo people they look on as having no right \\nTo pick where they\\'re picking. But we won\\'t complain. \\nYou ought to have seen how it looked in the rain, \\nThe fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves, \\nLike two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.\"',\n",

It seems to me\\nI can’t express my feelings any more\\nThan I can raise my voice or want to lift\\nMy hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).\\nDid ever you feel so? I hope you never.\\nIt’s got so I don’t even know for sure\\nWhether I am glad, sorry, or anything.\\nThere’s nothing but a voice-like left inside\\nThat seems to tell me how I ought to feel,\\nAnd would feel if I wasn’t all gone wrong.\\nYou take the lake. I look and look at it.\\nI see it’s a fair, pretty sheet of water.\\nI stand and make myself repeat out loud\\nThe advantages it has, so long and narrow,\\nLike a deep piece of some old running river\\nCut short off at both ends. It lies five miles\\nStraight away through the mountain notch\\nFrom the sink window where I wash the plates,\\nAnd all our storms come up toward the house,\\nDrawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.\\nIt took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit\\nTo step outdoors and take the water dazzle\\nA sunny morning, or take the rising wind\\nAbout my face and body and through my wrapper,\\nWhen a storm threatened from the Dragon’s Den,\\nAnd a cold chill shivered across the lake.\\nI see it’s a fair, pretty sheet of water,\\nOur Willoughby! How did you hear of it?\\nI expect, though, everyone’s heard of it.\\nIn a book about ferns? Listen to that!\\nYou let things more like feathers regulate\\nYour going and coming. And you like it here?\\nI can see how you might. But I don’t know!\\nIt would be different if more people came,\\nFor then there would be business. As it is,\\nThe cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,\\nSometimes we don’t. We’ve a good piece of shore\\nThat ought to be worth something, and may yet.\\nBut I don’t count on it as much as Len.\\nHe looks on the bright side of everything,\\nIncluding me. He thinks I’ll be all right\\nWith doctoring. But it’s not medicine–\\nLowe is the only doctor’s dared to say so–\\nIt’s rest I want–there, I have said it out–\\nFrom cooking meals for hungry hired men\\nAnd washing dishes after them–from doing\\nThings over and over that just won’t stay done.\\nBy good rights I ought not to have so much\\nPut on me, but there seems no other way.\\nLen says one steady pull more ought to do it.\\nHe says the best way out is always through.\\nAnd I agree to that, or in so far\\nAs that I can see no way out but through–\\nLeastways for me–and then they’ll be convinced.\\nIt’s not that Len don’t want the best for me.\\nIt was his plan our moving over in\\nBeside the lake from where that day I showed you\\nWe used to live–ten miles from anywhere.\\nWe didn’t change without some sacrifice,\\nBut Len went at it to make up the loss.\\nHis work’s a man’s, of course, from sun to sun,\\nBut he works when he works as hard as I do–\\nThough there’s small profit in comparisons.\\n(Women and men will make them all the same.)\\nBut work ain’t all.

I was prejudiced;\\nI wouldn’t have sent anyone of mine there;\\nYou know the old idea–the only asylum\\nWas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\\nRather than send their folks to such a place,\\nKept them at home; and it does seem more human.\\nBut it’s not so: the place is the asylum.\\nThere they have every means proper to do with,\\nAnd you aren’t darkening other people’s lives–\\nWorse than no good to them, and they no good\\nTo you in your condition; you can’t know\\nAffection or the want of it in that state.\\nI’ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\\nMy father’s brother, he went mad quite young.\\nSome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\\nBecause his violence took on the form\\nOf carrying his pillow in his teeth;\\nBut it’s more likely he was crossed in love,\\nOr so the story goes. It was some girl.\\nAnyway all he talked about was love.\\nThey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\\nIf he wa’n’t kept strict watch of, and it ended\\nIn father’s building him a sort of cage,\\nOr room within a room, of hickory poles,\\nLike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,–\\nA narrow passage all the way around.\\nAnything they put in for furniture\\nHe’d tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\\nSo they made the place comfortable with straw,\\nLike a beast’s stall, to ease their consciences.\\nOf course they had to feed him without dishes.\\nThey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\\nWith his clothes on his arm–all of his clothes.\\nCruel–it sounds. I ‘spose they did the best\\nThey knew. And just when he was at the height,\\nFather and mother married, and mother came,\\nA bride, to help take care of such a creature,\\nAnd accommodate her young life to his.\\nThat was what marrying father meant to her.\\nShe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\\nBy his shouts in the night. He’d shout and shout\\nUntil the strength was shouted out of him,\\nAnd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\\nHe’d pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\\nAnd let them go and make them twang until\\nHis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\\nAnd then he’d crow as if he thought that child’s play–\\nThe only fun he had. I’ve heard them say, though,\\nThey found a way to put a stop to it.\\nHe was before my time–I never saw him;\\nBut the pen stayed exactly as it was\\nThere in the upper chamber in the ell,\\nA sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\\nI often think of the smooth hickory bars.\\nIt got so I would say–you know, half fooling–\\n“It’s time I took my turn upstairs in jail”–\\nJust as you will till it becomes a habit.\\nNo wonder I was glad to get away.\\nMind you, I waited till Len said the word.\\nI didn’t want the blame if things went wrong.\\nI was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\\nAnd I looked to be happy, and I was,\\nAs I said, for a while–but I don’t know!\\nSomehow the change wore out like a prescription.\\nAnd there’s more to it than just window-views\\nAnd living by a lake. I’m past such help–\\nUnless Len took the notion, which he won’t,\\nAnd I won’t ask him–it’s not sure enough.\\nI ‘spose I’ve got to go the road I’m going:\\nOther folks have to, and why shouldn’t I?\\nI almost think if I could do like you,\\nDrop everything and live out on the ground–\\nBut it might be, come night, I shouldn’t like it,\\nOr a long rain. I should soon get enough,\\nAnd be glad of a good roof overhead.\\nI’ve lain awake thinking of you, I’ll warrant,\\nMore than you have yourself, some of these nights.\\nThe wonder was the tents weren’t snatched away\\nFrom over you as you lay in your beds.\\nI haven’t courage for a risk like that.\\nBless you, of course, you’re keeping me from work,\\nBut the thing of it is, I need to be kept.\\nThere’s work enough to do–there’s always that;\\nBut behind’s behind. The worst that you can do\\nIs set me back a little more behind.\\nI sha’n’t catch up in this world, anyway.\\nI’d rather you’d not go unless you must.',\n",

              " 'There were three in the meadow by the brook, \\nGathering up windrows, piling haycocks up, \\nWith an eye always lifted toward the west, \\nWhere an irregular, sun-bordered cloud \\nDarkly advanced with a perpetual dagger \\nFlickering across its bosom. Suddenly \\nOne helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground, \\nMarched himself off the field and home. One stayed. \\nThe town-bred farmer failed to understand.\\nWhat was there wrong? \\nSomething you said just now. \\nWhat did I say? \\nAbout our taking pains. \\nTo cock the hay?—because it’s going to shower? \\nI said that nearly half an hour ago. \\nI said it to myself as much as you.\\nYou didn’t know. But James is one big fool. \\nHe thought you meant to find fault with his work. \\nThat’s what the average farmer would have meant. \\nJames had to take his time to chew it over \\nBefore he acted; he’s just got round to act.\\nHe is a fool if that’s the way he takes me.\\nDon’t let it bother you. You’ve found out something. \\nThe hand that knows his business won’t be told \\nTo do work faster or better—those two things. \\nI’m as particular as anyone: \\nMost likely I’d have served you just the same: \\nBut I know you don’t understand our ways. \\nYou were just talking what was in your mind, \\nWhat was in all our minds, and you weren’t hinting. \\nTell you a story of what happened once. \\nI was up here in Salem, at a man’s \\nNamed Sanders, with a gang of four or five, \\nDoing the haying. No one liked the boss. \\nHe was one of the kind sports call a spider, \\nAll wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy \\nFrom a humped body nigh as big as a biscuit. \\nBut work!—that man could work, especially \\nIf by so doing he could get more work \\nOut of his hired help. I’m not denying \\nHe was hard on himself: I couldn’t find \\nThat he kept any hours—not for himself. \\nDay-light and lantern-light were one to him: \\nI’ve heard him pounding in the barn all night. \\nBut what he liked was someone to encourage. \\nThem that he couldn’t lead he’d get behind \\nAnd drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing \\nKeep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off. \\nI’d seen about enough of his bulling tricks— \\nWe call that bulling. I’d been watching him. \\nSo when he paired off with me in the hayfield \\nTo load the load, thinks I, look out for trouble! \\nI built the load and topped it off; old Sanders \\nCombed it down with the rake and said, ‘O. K.’ \\nEverything went right till we reached the barn \\nWith a big take to empty in a bay. \\nYou understand that meant the easy job \\nFor the man up on top of throwing down \\nThe hay and rolling it off wholesale, \\nWhere, on a mow, it would have been slow lifting. \\nYou wouldn’t think a fellow ‘d need much urging \\nUnder those circumstances, would you now? \\nBut the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, \\nAnd looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, \\nShouts like an army captain, ‘Let her come!’ \\nThinks I, d’ye mean it? ‘What was that you said?’ \\nI asked out loud so’s there’d be no mistake. \\n‘Did you say, let her come?’ ‘Yes, let her come.’ \\nHe said it over, but he said it softer. \\nNever you say a thing like that to a man, \\nNot if he values what he is. God, I’d as soon \\nMurdered him as left out his middle name. \\nI’d built the load and knew just where to find it. \\nTwo or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for \\nLike meditating, and then I just dug in \\nAnd dumped the rackful on him in ten lots. \\nI looked over the side once in the dust \\nAnd caught sight of him treading-water-like, \\nKeeping his head above. ‘Damn ye,’ I says, \\n‘That gets ye!’ He squeaked like a squeezed rat.\\nThat was the last I saw or heard of him. \\nI cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. \\nAs I sat mopping the hayseed from my neck, \\nAnd sort of waiting to be asked about it, \\nOne of the boys sings out, ‘Where’s the old man?’ \\n‘I left him in the barn,—under the hay. \\nIf you want him you can go and dig him out.’ \\nThey realized from the way I swobbed my neck \\nMore than was needed, something must be up. \\nThey headed for the barn I stayed where I was. \\nThey told me afterward: First they forked hay, \\nA lot of it, out into the barn floor. \\nNothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle!\\nI guess they thought I’d spiked him in the temple \\nBefore I buried him, else I couldn’t have managed. \\nThey excavated more. ‘Go keep his wife \\nOut of the barn.’\\nSome one looked in a window; \\nAnd curse me, if he wasn’t in the kitchen, \\nSlumped way down in a chair, with both his feet \\nStuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer. \\nHe looked so mad in back, and so disgusted \\nThere was no one that dared to stir him up \\nOr let him know that he was being looked at. \\nApparently I hadn’t buried him \\n(I may have knocked him down), but just my trying \\nTo bury him had hurt his dignity. \\nHe had gone to the house so’s not to face me. \\nHe kept away from us all afternoon. \\nWe tended to his hay. We saw him out \\nAfter a while picking peas in the garden: \\nHe couldn’t keep away from doing something.\\nWeren’t you relieved to find he wasn’t dead?\\nNo!—and yet I can’t say: it’s hard to tell. \\nI went about to kill him fair enough.\\nYou took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?\\nDischarge me? No! He knew I did just right.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'A governor it was proclaimed this time,\\nWhen all who would come seeking in New Hampshire\\nAncestral memories might come together.\\nAnd those of the name Stark gathered in Bow,\\nA rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off,\\nAnd sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone.\\nSomeone had literally run to earth\\nIn an old cellar hole in a by-road\\nThe origin of all the family there.\\nThence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe\\nThat now not all the houses left in town\\nMade shift to shelter them without the help\\nOf here and there a tent in grove and orchard.\\nThey were at Bow, but that was not enough:\\nNothing would do but they must fix a day\\nTo stand together on the crater’s verge\\nThat turned them on the world, and try to fathom\\nThe past and get some strangeness out of it.\\nBut rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain,\\nWith clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.\\nThe young folk held some hope out to each other\\nTill well toward noon when the storm settled down\\nWith a swish in the grass. “What if the others\\nAre there,” they said. “It isn’t going to rain.”\\nOnly one from a farm not far away\\nStrolled thither, not expecting he would find\\nAnyone else, but out of idleness.\\nOne, and one other, yes, for there were two.\\nThe second round the curving hillside road\\nWas a girl; and she halted some way off\\nTo reconnoitre, and then made up her mind\\nAt least to pass by and see who he was,\\nAnd perhaps hear some word about the weather.\\nThis was some Stark she didn’t know. He nodded.\\n“No fête to-day,” he said.\\n“It looks that way.”\\nShe swept the heavens, turning on her heel.\\n“I only idled down.”\\n“I idled down.”\\nProvision there had been for just such meeting\\nOf stranger cousins, in a family tree\\nDrawn on a sort of passport with the branch\\nOf the one bearing it done in detail—\\nSome zealous one’s laborious device.\\nShe made a sudden movement toward her bodice,\\nAs one who clasps her heart. They laughed together.\\n“Stark?” he inquired. “No matter for the proof.”\\n“Yes, Stark. And you?”\\n“I’m Stark.” He drew his passport.\\n“You know we might not be and still be cousins:\\nThe town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys,\\nAll claiming some priority in Starkness.\\nMy mother was a Lane, yet might have married\\nAnyone upon earth and still her children\\nWould have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day.”\\n“You riddle with your genealogy\\nLike a Viola. I don’t follow you.”\\n“I only mean my mother was a Stark\\nSeveral times over, and by marrying father\\nNo more than brought us back into the name.”\\n“One ought not to be thrown into confusion\\nBy a plain statement of relationship,\\nBut I own what you say makes my head spin.\\nYou take my card—you seem so good at such things—\\nAnd see if you can reckon our cousinship.\\nWhy not take seats here on the cellar wall\\nAnd dangle feet among the raspberry vines?”\\n“Under the shelter of the family tree.”\\n“Just so—that ought to be enough protection.”\\n“Not from the rain. I think it’s going to rain.”\\n“It’s raining.”\\n“No, it’s misting; let’s be fair.\\nDoes the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?”\\nThe situation was like this: the road\\nBowed outward on the mountain half-way up,\\nAnd disappeared and ended not far off.\\nNo one went home that way. The only house\\nBeyond where they were was a shattered seedpod.\\nAnd below roared a brook hidden in trees,\\nThe sound of which was silence for the place.\\nThis he sat listening to till she gave judgment.\\n“On father’s side, it seems, we’re—let me see——”\\n“Don’t be too technical.—You have three cards.”\\n“Four cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch\\nOf the Stark family I’m a member of.”\\n“D’you know a person so related to herself\\nIs supposed to be mad.”\\n“I may be mad.”\\n“You look so, sitting out here in the rain\\nStudying genealogy with me\\nYou never saw before. What will we come to\\nWith all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees?\\nI think we’re all mad. Tell me why we’re here\\nDrawn into town about this cellar hole\\nLike wild geese on a lake before a storm?\\nWhat do we see in such a hole, I wonder.”\\n“The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc,\\nWhich means The Seven Caves that We Came out of.\\nThis is the pit from which we Starks were digged.”\\n“You must be learned. That’s what you see in it?”\\n“And what do you see?”\\n“Yes, what do I see?\\nFirst let me look. I see raspberry vines—”\\n“Oh, if you’re going to use your eyes, just hear\\nWhat I see. It’s a little, little boy,\\nAs pale and dim as a match flame in the sun;\\nHe’s groping in the cellar after jam,\\nHe thinks it’s dark and it’s flooded with daylight.”\\n“He’s nothing. Listen. When I lean like this\\nI can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,—\\nWith his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug—\\nBless you, it isn’t Grandsir Stark, it’s Granny,\\nBut the pipe’s there and smoking and the jug.\\nShe’s after cider, the old girl, she’s thirsty;\\nHere’s hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely.”\\n“Tell me about her. Does she look like me?”\\n“She should, shouldn’t she, you’re so many times\\nOver descended from her. I believe\\nShe does look like you. Stay the way you are.\\nThe nose is just the same, and so’s the chin—\\nMaking allowance, making due allowance.”\\n“You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!”\\n“See that you get her greatness right. Don’t stint her.”\\n“Yes, it’s important, though you think it isn’t.\\nI won’t be teased. But see how wet I am.”\\n“Yes, you must go; we can’t stay here for ever.\\nBut wait until I give you a hand up.\\nA bead of silver water more or less\\nStrung on your hair won’t hurt your summer looks.\\nI wanted to try something with the noise\\nThat the brook raises in the empty valley.\\nWe have seen visions—now consult the voices.\\nSomething I must have learned riding in trains\\nWhen I was young. I used the roar\\nTo set the voices speaking out of it,\\nSpeaking or singing, and the band-music playing.\\nPerhaps you have the art of what I mean.\\nI’ve never listened in among the sounds\\nThat a brook makes in such a wild descent.\\nIt ought to give a purer oracle.”\\n“It’s as you throw a picture on a screen:\\nThe meaning of it all is out of you;\\nThe voices give you what you wish to hear.”\\n“Strangely, it’s anything they wish to give.”\\n“Then I don’t know. It must be strange enough.\\nI wonder if it’s not your make-believe.\\nWhat do you think you’re like to hear to-day?”\\n“From the sense of our having been together—\\nBut why take time for what I’m like to hear?\\nI’ll tell you what the voices really say.\\nYou will do very well right where you are\\nA little longer. I mustn’t feel too hurried,\\nOr I can’t give myself to hear the voices.”\\n“Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?”\\n“You must be very still; you mustn’t talk.”\\n“I’ll hardly breathe.”\\n“The voices seem to say——”\\n“I’m waiting.”\\n“Don’t! The voices seem to say:\\nCall her Nausicaa, the unafraid\\nOf an acquaintance made adventurously.”\\n“I let you say that—on consideration.”\\n“I don’t see very well how you can help it.\\nYou want the truth. I speak but by the voices.\\nYou see they know I haven’t had your name,\\nThough what a name should matter between us——”\\n“I shall suspect——”\\n“Be good. The voices say:\\nCall her Nausicaa, and take a timber\\nThat you shall find lies in the cellar charred\\nAmong the raspberries, and hew and shape it\\nFor a door-sill or other corner piece\\nIn a new cottage on the ancient spot.\\nThe life is not yet all gone out of it.\\nAnd come and make your summer dwelling here,\\nAnd perhaps she will come, still unafraid,\\nAnd sit before you in the open door\\nWith flowers in her lap until they fade,\\nBut not come in across the sacred sill——”\\n“I wonder where your oracle is tending.\\nYou can see that there’s something wrong with it,\\nOr it would speak in dialect. Whose voice\\nDoes it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir’s\\nNor Granny’s, surely. Call up one of them.\\nThey have best right to be heard in this place.”\\n“You seem so partial to our great-grandmother\\n(Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.)\\nYou will be likely to regard as sacred\\nAnything she may say. But let me warn you,\\nFolks in her day were given to plain speaking.\\nYou think you’d best tempt her at such a time?”\\n“It rests with us always to cut her off.”\\n“Well then, it’s Granny speaking: ‘I dunnow!\\nMebbe I’m wrong to take it as I do.\\nThere ain’t no names quite like the old ones though,\\nNor never will be to my way of thinking.\\nOne mustn’t bear too hard on the new comers,\\nBut there’s a dite too many of them for comfort.\\nI should feel easier if I could see\\nMore of the salt wherewith they’re to be salted.\\nSon, you do as you’re told! You take the timber—\\nIt’s as sound as the day when it was cut—\\nAnd begin over——’ There, she’d better stop.\\nYou can see what is troubling Granny, though.\\nBut don’t you think we sometimes make too much\\nOf the old stock? What counts is the ideals,\\nAnd those will bear some keeping still about.”\\n“I can see we are going to be good friends.”\\n“I like your ‘going to be.’ You said just now\\nIt’s going to rain.”\\n“I know, and it was raining.\\nI let you say all that. But I must go now.”\\n“You let me say it? on consideration?\\nHow shall we say good-bye in such a case?”\\n“How shall we?”\\n“Will you leave the way to me?”\\n“No, I don’t trust your eyes. You’ve said enough.\\nNow give me your hand up.—Pick me that flower.”\\n“Where shall we meet again?”\\n“Nowhere but here\\nOnce more before we meet elsewhere.”\\n“In rain?”\\n“It ought to be in rain. Sometime in rain.\\nIn rain to-morrow, shall we, if it rains?\\nBut if we must, in sunshine.” So she went.',\n",
              " 'I let myself in at the kitchen door.\\n‘It’s you,’ she said. ‘I can’t get up. Forgive me \\nNot answering your knock. I can no more \\nLet people in than I can keep them out. \\nI’m getting too old for my size, I tell them. \\nMy fingers are about all I’ve the use of \\nSo’s to take any comfort. I can sew: \\nI help out with this beadwork what I can.’ \\n‘That’s a smart pair of pumps you’re beading there. \\nWho are they for?’ \\n‘You mean?- oh, for some miss. \\nI can’t keep track of other people’s daughters. \\nLord, if I were to dream of everyone \\nWhose shoes I primped to dance in!’ \\n‘And where’s John?’ \\n‘Haven’t you seen him? Strange what set you off \\nTo come to his house when he’s gone to yours. \\nYou can’t have passed each other. I know what: \\nHe must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands. \\nHe won’t be long in that case. You can wait. \\nThough what good you can be, or anyone- \\nIt’s gone so far. You’ve heard? Estelle’s run off.’ \\n‘Yes, what’s it all about? When did she go?’ \\n‘Two weeks since.’ \\n‘She’s in earnest, it appears.’ \\n‘I’m sure she won’t come back. She’s hiding somewhere. \\nI don’t know where myself. John thinks I do. \\nHe thinks I only have to say the word, \\nAnd she’ll come back. But, bless you, I’m her mother- \\nI can’t talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!’ \\n‘It will go hard with John. What will he do? \\nHe can’t find anyone to take her place.’ \\n‘Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do? \\nHe gets some sort of bakeshop meals together, \\nWith me to sit and tell him everything, \\nWhat’s wanted and how much and where it is. \\nBut when I’m gone- of course I can’t stay here: \\nEstelle’s to take me when she’s settled down. \\nHe and I only hinder one another. \\nI tell them they can’t get me through the door, though: \\nI’ve been built in here like a big church organ. \\nWe’ve been here fifteen years.’ \\n‘That’s a long time \\nTo live together and then pull apart. \\nHow do you see him living when you’re gone? \\nTwo of you out will leave an empty house.’ \\n‘I don’t just see him living many years, \\nLeft here with nothing but the furniture. \\nI hate to think of the old place when we’re gone, \\nWith the brook going by below the yard, \\nAnd no one here but hens blowing about. \\nIf he could sell the place, but then, he can’t: \\nNo one will ever live on it again. \\nIt’s too run down. This is the last of it. \\nWhat I think he will do, is let things smash. \\nHe’ll sort of swear the time away. He’s awful! \\nI never saw a man let family troubles \\nMake so much difference in his man’s affairs. \\nHe’s just dropped everything. He’s like a child. \\nI blame his being brought up by his mother. \\nHe’s got hay down that’s been rained on three times. \\nHe hoed a little yesterday for me: \\nI thought the growing things would do him good. \\nSomething went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe \\nSky-high with both hands. I can see it now- \\nCome here- I’ll show you- in that apple tree. \\nThat’s no way for a man to do at his age: \\nHe’s fifty-five, you know, if he’s a day.’ \\n‘Aren’t you afraid of him? What’s that gun for?’ \\n‘Oh, that’s been there for hawks since chicken-time. \\nJohn Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends. \\nI’ll say that for him, John’s no threatener \\nLike some men folk. No one’s afraid of him; \\nAll is, he’s made up his mind not to stand \\nWhat he has got to stand.’ \\n‘Where is Estelle? \\nCouldn’t one talk to her? What does she say? \\nYou say you don’t know where she is.’ \\n‘Nor want to! \\nShe thinks if it was bad to live with him, \\nIt must be right to leave him.’ \\n‘Which is wrong!’ \\n‘Yes, but he should have married her.’ \\n‘I know.’ \\n‘The strain’s been too much for her all these years: \\nI can’t explain it any other way. \\nIt’s different with a man, at least with John: \\nHe knows he’s kinder than the run of men. \\nBetter than married ought to be as good \\nAs married- that’s what he has always said. \\nI know the way he’s felt- but all the same!’ \\n‘I wonder why he doesn’t marry her \\nAnd end it.’ \\n‘Too late now: she wouldn’t have him. \\nHe’s given her time to think of something else. \\nThat’s his mistake. The dear knows my interest \\nHas been to keep the thing from breaking up. \\nThis is a good home: I don’t ask for better. \\nBut when I’ve said, ‘Why shouldn’t they be married,’ \\nHe’d say, ‘Why should they?’ no more words than that.’ \\n‘And after all why should they? John’s been fair \\nI take it. What was his was always hers. \\nThere was no quarrel about property.’ \\n‘Reason enough, there was no property. \\nA friend or two as good as own the farm, \\nSuch as it is. It isn’t worth the mortgage.’ \\n‘I mean Estelle has always held the purse.’ \\n‘The rights of that are harder to get at. \\nI guess Estelle and I have filled the purse. \\n‘Twas we let him have money, not he us. \\nJohn’s a bad farmer. I’m not blaming him. \\nTake it year in, year out, he doesn’t make much. \\nWe came here for a home for me, you know, \\nEstelle to do the housework for the board \\nOf both of us. But look how it turns out: \\nShe seems to have the housework, and besides, \\nHalf of the outdoor work, though as for that, \\nHe’d say she does it more because she likes it. \\nYou see our pretty things are all outdoors. \\nOur hens and cows and pigs are always better \\nThan folks like us have any business with. \\nFarmers around twice as well off as we \\nHaven’t as good. They don’t go with the farm. \\nOne thing you can’t help liking about John, \\nHe’s fond of nice things- too fond, some would say. \\nBut Estelle don’t complain: she’s like him there. \\nShe wants our hens to be the best there are. \\nYou never saw this room before a show, \\nFull of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds \\nIn separate coops, having their plumage done. \\nThe smell of the wet feathers in the heat! \\nYou spoke of John’s not being safe to stay with. \\nYou don’t know what a gentle lot we are: \\nWe wouldn’t hurt a hen! You ought to see us \\nMoving a flock of hens from place to place. \\nWe’re not allowed to take them upside down, \\nAll we can hold together by the legs. \\nTwo at a time’s the rule, one on each arm, \\nNo matter how far and how many times \\nWe have to go.’ \\n‘You mean that’s John’s idea.’ \\n‘And we live up to it; or I don’t know \\nWhat childishness he wouldn’t give way to. \\nHe manages to keep the upper hand \\nOn his own farm. He’s boss. But as to hens: \\nWe fence our flowers in and the hens range. \\nNothing’s too good for them. We say it pays. \\nJohn likes to tell the offers he has had, \\nTwenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. \\nHe never takes the money. If they’re worth \\nThat much to sell, they’re worth as much to keep. \\nBless you, it’s all expense, though. Reach me down \\nThe little tin box on the cupboard shelf, \\nThe upper shelf, the tin box. That’s the one. \\nI’ll show you. Here you are.’ \\n‘What’s this?’ \\n‘A bill- \\nFor fifty dollars for one Langshang cock- \\nReceipted. And the cock is in the yard.’ \\n‘Not in a glass case, then?’ \\n‘He’d need a tall one: \\nHe can eat off a barrel from the ground. \\nHe’s been in a glass case, as you may say, \\nThe Crystal Palace, London. He’s imported. \\nJohn bought him, and we paid the bill with beads- \\nWampum, I call it. Mind, we don’t complain. \\nBut you see, don’t you, we take care of him.’ \\n‘And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.’ \\n‘It seems as if. And that’s not all: he’s helpless \\nIn ways that I can hardly tell you of. \\nSometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts \\nTo see where all the money goes so fast. \\nYou know how men will be ridiculous. \\nBut it’s just fun the way he gets bedeviled- \\nIf he’s untidy now, what will he be- – ? \\n‘It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.’ \\n‘Estelle’s the one. You needn’t talk to me.’ \\n‘Can’t you and I get to the root of it? \\nWhat’s the real trouble? What will satisfy her?’ \\n‘It’s as I say: she’s turned from him, that’s all.’ \\n‘But why, when she’s well off? Is it the neighbours, \\nBeing cut off from friends?’ \\n‘We have our friends. \\nThat isn’t it. Folks aren’t afraid of us.’ \\n‘She’s let it worry her. You stood the strain, \\nAnd you’re her mother.’ \\n‘But I didn’t always. \\nI didn’t relish it along at first. \\nBut I got wonted to it. And besides- \\nJohn said I was too old to have grandchildren. \\nBut what’s the use of talking when it’s done? \\nShe won’t come back- it’s worse than that- she can’t.’ \\n‘Why do you speak like that? What do you know? \\nWhat do you mean?- she’s done harm to herself?’ \\n‘I mean she’s married- married someone else.’ \\n‘Oho, oho!’ \\n‘You don’t believe me.’ \\n‘Yes, I do, \\nOnly too well. I knew there must be something! \\nSo that was what was back. She’s bad, that’s all!’ \\n‘Bad to get married when she had the chance?’ \\n‘Nonsense! See what’s she done! But who, who- – ‘ \\n‘Who’d marry her straight out of such a mess? \\nSay it right out- no matter for her mother. \\nThe man was found. I’d better name no names. \\nJohn himself won’t imagine who he is.’ \\n‘Then it’s all up. I think I’ll get away. \\nYou’ll be expecting John. I pity Estelle; \\nI suppose she deserves some pity, too. \\nYou ought to have the kitchen to yourself \\nTo break it to him. You may have the job.’ \\n‘You needn’t think you’re going to get away. \\nJohn’s almost here. I’ve had my eye on someone \\nComing down Ryan’s Hill. I thought ’twas him. \\nHere he is now. This box! Put it away. \\nAnd this bill.’ \\n‘What’s the hurry? He’ll unhitch.’ \\n‘No, he won’t, either. He’ll just drop the reins \\nAnd turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all. \\nShe won’t get far before the wheels hang up \\nOn something- there’s no harm. See, there he is! \\nMy, but he looks as if he must have heard!’ \\nJohn threw the door wide but he didn’t enter.\\n‘How are you, neighbour? Just the man I’m after. \\nIsn’t it Hell,’ he said. ‘I want to know. \\nCome out here if you want to hear me talk. \\nI’ll talk to you, old woman, afterward. \\nI’ve got some news that maybe isn’t news. \\nWhat are they trying to do to me, these two?’ \\n‘Do go along with him and stop his shouting.’ \\nShe raised her voice against the closing door:\\n‘Who wants to hear your news, you- dreadful fool?’',\n",

When’s he coming?”\\n“I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose\\nTo try to help me drive a better bargain.”\\n“Well, if it’s true! Yours are no common feet.\\nThe lawyer don’t know what it is he’s buying:\\nSo many miles you might have walked you won’t walk.\\nYou haven’t run your forty orchids down.\\nWhat does he think?—How are the blessed feet?\\nThe doctor’s sure you’re going to walk again?”\\n“He thinks I’ll hobble. It’s both legs and feet.”\\n“They must be terrible—I mean to look at.”\\n“I haven’t dared to look at them uncovered.\\nThrough the bed blankets I remind myself\\nOf a starfish laid out with rigid points.”\\n“The wonder is it hadn’t been your head.”\\n“It’s hard to tell you how I managed it.\\nWhen I saw the shaft had me by the coat,\\nI didn’t try too long to pull away,\\nOr fumble for my knife to cut away,\\nI just embraced the shaft and rode it out—\\nTill Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit.\\nThat’s how I think I didn’t lose my head.\\nBut my legs got their knocks against the ceiling.”\\n“Awful. Why didn’t they throw off the belt\\nInstead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?”\\n“They say some time was wasted on the belt—\\nOld streak of leather—doesn’t love me much\\nBecause I make him spit fire at my knuckles,\\nThe way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string.\\nThat must be it. Some days he won’t stay on.\\nThat day a woman couldn’t coax him off.\\nHe’s on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth\\nSnatched right and left across the silver pulleys.\\nEverything goes the same without me there.\\nYou can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw\\nCaterwaul to the hills around the village\\nAs they both bite the wood.

Come, stand by the bed;\\nTell me what is it?” Anne just wagged her dress\\nWith both hands held behind her. “Guess,” she said.\\n“Oh, guess which hand? My my!

I think I’ll take the right.\\nThat’s sure to be right even if it’s wrong.\\nCome, hold it out. Don’t change.—A Ram’s Horn orchid!\\nA Ram’s Horn! What would I have got, I wonder,\\nIf I had chosen left. Hold out the left.\\nAnother Ram’s Horn! Where did you find those,\\nUnder what beech tree, on what woodchuck’s knoll?”\\nAnne looked at the large lawyer at her side,\\nAnd thought she wouldn’t venture on so much.\\n“Were there no others?”\\n“There were four or five.\\nI knew you wouldn’t let me pick them all.”\\n“I wouldn’t—so I wouldn’t. You’re the girl!\\nYou see Anne has her lesson learned by heart.”\\n“I wanted there should be some there next year.”\\n“Of course you did. You left the rest for seed,\\nAnd for the backwoods woodchuck. You’re the girl!\\nA Ram’s Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck\\nSounds something like. Better than farmer’s beans\\nTo a discriminating appetite,\\nThough the Ram’s Horn is seldom to be had\\nIn bushel lots—doesn’t come on the market.\\nBut, Anne, I’m troubled; have you told me all?\\nYou’re hiding something. That’s as bad as lying.\\nYou ask this lawyer man. And it’s not safe\\nWith a lawyer at hand to find you out.\\nNothing is hidden from some people, Anne.\\nYou don’t tell me that where you found a Ram’s Horn\\nYou didn’t find a Yellow Lady’s Slipper.\\nWhat did I tell you? What? I’d blush, I would.\\nDon’t you defend yourself. If it was there,\\nWhere is it now, the Yellow Lady’s Slipper?”\\n“Well, wait—it’s common—it’s too common.”\\n“Common?\\nThe Purple Lady’s Slipper’s commoner.”\\n“I didn’t bring a Purple Lady’s Slipper\\nTo You—to you I mean—they’re both too common.”\\nThe lawyer gave a laugh among his papers\\nAs if with some idea that she had scored.\\n“I’ve broken Anne of gathering bouquets.\\nIt’s not fair to the child. It can’t be helped though:\\nPressed into service means pressed out of shape.\\nSomehow I’ll make it right with her—she’ll see.\\nShe’s going to do my scouting in the field,\\nOver stone walls and all along a wood\\nAnd by a river bank for water flowers,\\nThe floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,\\nAnd at the sinus under water a fist\\nOf little fingers all kept down but one,\\nAnd that thrust up to blossom in the sun\\nAs if to say, ‘You! You’re the Heart’s desire.’\\nAnne has a way with flowers to take the place\\nOf that she’s lost: she goes down on one knee\\nAnd lifts their faces by the chin to hers\\nAnd says their names, and leaves them where they are.”\\nThe lawyer wore a watch the case of which\\nWas cunningly devised to make a noise\\nLike a small pistol when he snapped it shut\\nAt such a time as this. He snapped it now.\\n“Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait.\\nThe lawyer man is thinking of his train.\\nHe wants to give me lots and lots of money\\nBefore he goes, because I hurt myself,\\nAnd it may take him I don’t know how long.\\nBut put our flowers in water first. Will, help her:\\nThe pitcher’s too full for her. There’s no cup?\\nJust hook them on the inside of the pitcher.\\nNow run.—Get out your documents! You see\\nI have to keep on the good side of Anne.\\nI’m a great boy to think of number one.\\nAnd you can’t blame me in the place I’m in.\\nWho will take care of my necessities\\nUnless I do?”\\n“A pretty interlude,”\\nThe lawyer said. “I’m sorry, but my train—\\nLuckily terms are all agreed upon.\\nYou only have to sign your name. Right—there.”\\n“You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here\\nWhere you can’t make them. What is it you want?\\nI’ll put you out with Anne. Be good or go.”\\n“You don’t mean you will sign that thing unread?”\\n“Make yourself useful then, and read it for me.\\nIsn’t it something I have seen before?”\\n“You’ll find it is. Let your friend look at it.”\\n“Yes, but all that takes time, and I’m as much\\nIn haste to get it over with as you.\\nBut read it, read it. That’s right, draw the curtain:\\nHalf the time I don’t know what’s troubling me.—\\nWhat do you say, Will? Don’t you be a fool,\\nYou! crumpling folkses legal documents.\\nOut with it if you’ve any real objection.”\\n“Five hundred dollars!”\\n“What would you think right?”\\n“A thousand wouldn’t be a cent too much;\\nYou know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is\\nAccepting anything before he knows\\nWhether he’s ever going to walk again.\\nIt smells to me like a dishonest trick.”\\n“I think—I think—from what I heard to-day—\\nAnd saw myself—he would be ill-advised——”\\n“What did you hear, for instance?” Willis said.\\n“Now the place where the accident occurred——”\\nThe Broken One was twisted in his bed.\\n“This is between you two apparently.\\nWhere I come in is what I want to know.\\nYou stand up to it like a pair of cocks.\\nGo outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me.\\nWhen you come back, I’ll have the papers signed.\\nWill pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen.\\nOne of you hold my head up from the pillow.”\\nWillis flung off the bed. “I wash my hands—\\nI’m no match—no, and don’t pretend to be——”\\nThe lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen.\\n“You’re doing the wise thing: you won’t regret it.\\nWe’re very sorry for you.”\\nWillis sneered:\\n“Who’s we?—some stockholders in Boston?\\nI’ll go outdoors, by gad, and won’t come back.”\\n“Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come.\\nYes. Thanks for caring. Don’t mind Will: he’s savage.\\nHe thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers.\\nYou don’t know what I mean about the flowers.\\nDon’t stop to try to now.

And there its strength lay \\nFor the hard work. He chafed its long white body \\nFrom end to end with his rough hand shut round it. \\nHe tried it at the eye-hold in the axe-head. \\n‘Hahn, hahn,’ he mused, ‘don’t need much taking down.’ \\nBaptiste knew how to make a short job long \\nFor love of it, and yet not waste time either.\\nDo you know, what we talked about was knowledge? \\nBaptiste on his defence about the children \\nHe kept from school, or did his best to keep – \\nWhatever school and children and our doubts \\nOf laid-on education had to do \\nWith the curves of his axe-helves and his having \\nUsed these unscrupulously to bring me \\nTo see for once the inside of his house. \\nWas I desired in friendship, partly as some one \\nTo leave it to, whether the right to hold \\nSuch doubts of education should depend \\nUpon the education of those who held them. \\nBut now he brushed the shavings from his knee \\nAnd stood the axe there on its horse’s hoof, \\nErect, but not without its waves, as when \\nThe snake stood up for evil in the Garden’- \\nTop-heavy with a heaviness his short, \\nThick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down \\nAnd in a little – a French touch in that. \\nBaptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased; \\n‘See how she’s cock her head.',\n",

It wasn’t Toffile:\\nIt wasn’t anyone who could be there.\\nThe bulkhead double-doors were double-locked\\nAnd swollen tight and buried under snow.\\nThe cellar windows were banked up with sawdust\\nAnd swollen tight and buried under snow.\\nIt was the bones. I knew them – and good reason.\\nMy first impulse was to get to the knob\\nAnd hold the door. But the bones didn’t try\\nThe door; they halted helpless on the landing,\\nWaiting for things to happen in their favour.’\\nThe faintest restless rustling ran all through them.\\nI never could have done the thing I did\\nIf the wish hadn’t been too strong in me\\nTo see how they were mounted for this walk.\\nI had a vision of them put together\\nNot like a man, but like a chandelier.\\nSo suddenly I flung the door wide on him.\\nA moment he stood balancing with emotion,\\nAnd all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire\\nFlashed out and licked along his upper teeth.\\nSmoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)\\nThen he came at me with one hand outstretched,\\nThe way he did in life once; but this time\\nI struck the hand off brittle on the floor,\\nAnd fell back from him on the floor myself.\\nThe finger-pieces slid in all directions.\\n(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?\\nHand me my button-box- it must be there.)\\nI sat up on the floor and shouted, ‘Toffile,\\nIt’s coming up to you.’ It had its choice\\nOf the door to the cellar or the hall.\\nIt took the hall door for the novelty,\\nAnd set off briskly for so slow a thing,\\nStillgoing every which way in the joints, though,\\nSo that it looked like lightning or a scribble,\\n>From the slap I had just now given its hand.\\nI listened till it almost climbed the stairs\\n>From the hall to the only finished bedroom,\\nBefore I got up to do anything;\\nThen ran and shouted, ‘Shut the bedroom door,\\nToffile, for my sake!’ ‘Company?’ he said,\\n‘Don’t make me get up; I’m too warm in bed.’\\nSo lying forward weakly on the handrail\\nI pushed myself upstairs, and in the light\\n(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own\\nI could see nothing. ‘Toffile, I don’t see it.\\nIt’s with us in the room though. It’s the bones.’\\n‘What bones?’ ‘The cellar bones- out of the grave.’\\nThat made him throw his bare legs out of bed\\nAnd sit up by me and take hold of me.\\nI wanted to put out the light and see\\nIf I could see it, or else mow the room,\\nWith our arms at the level of our knees,\\nAnd bring the chalk-pile down. ‘I’ll tell you what-\\nIt’s looking for another door to try.\\nThe uncommonly deep snow has made him think\\nOf his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy,\\nHe always used to sing along the tote-road.\\nHe’s after an open door to get out-doors.\\nLet’s trap him with an open door up attic.’\\nToffile agreed to that, and sure enough,\\nAlmost the moment he was given an opening,\\nThe steps began to climb the attic stairs.\\nI heard them. Toffile didn’t seem to hear them.\\n‘Quick !’ I slammed to the door and held the knob.\\n‘Toffile, get nails.’ I made him nail the door shut,\\nAnd push the headboard of the bed against it.\\nThen we asked was there anything\\nUp attic that we’d ever want again.\\nThe attic was less to us than the cellar.\\nIf the bones liked the attic, let them have it.\\nLet them stay in the attic. When they sometimes\\nCome down the stairs at night and stand perplexed\\nBehind the door and headboard of the bed,\\nBrushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,\\nWith sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,\\nThat’s what I sit up in the dark to say-\\nTo no one any more since Toffile died.\\n2o3 Let them stay in the attic since they went there.\\nI promised Toffile to be cruel to them\\nFor helping them be cruel once to him.\\nSON: We think they had a grave down in the cellar.\\nMOTHER: We know they had a grave down in the cellar.\\nSON: We never could find out whose bones they were.\\nMOTHER: Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once.\\nThey were a man’s his father killed for me.\\nI mean a man he killed instead of me.\\nThe least I could do was to help dig their grave.\\nWe were about it one night in the cellar.\\nSon knows the story: but ’twas not for him\\nTo tell the truth, suppose the time had come.\\nSon looks surprised to see me end a lie\\nWe’d kept all these years between ourselves\\nSo as to have it ready for outsiders.\\nBut to-night I don’t care enough to lie-\\nI don’t remember why I ever cared.\\nToffile, if he were here, I don’t believe\\nCould tell you why he ever cared himself-\\nShe hadn’t found the finger-bone she wanted\\nAmong the buttons poured out in her lap.\\nI verified the name next morning: Toffile.\\nThe rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway.',\n",
